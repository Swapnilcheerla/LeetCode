# Remove Dublicates from Sorted linked list 
Remove dublicates elements and return only unique one


# Approach
take a Dummy node and attach head to it where we can store prev 
- prev starts from dummy node which stores the just prev of dublicate element
- so that we can remove occurrences more than one
- curr checks current and next are equal loops until they are not equal
then prev.next  will be curr.next ( which was  next after the dummy element)
- if they are not equal prev  = prev.next this means bot curr and curr  next are not equal 
- curr will be always curr=curr.next

# Code
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
        dummy=ListNode(0,head)
        prev=dummy
        curr=head
        
        while curr and curr.next:
            
            if curr.val== curr.next.val:
                while curr.next and curr.val== curr.next.val:
                    curr=curr.next
                prev.next=curr.next
            else:
                prev=prev.next
            
            curr=curr.next
            
        return dummy.next
        
```

# Recursive approach

```python

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head # base case
        
        if head.val == head.next.val:
            while head.next and head.val== head.next.val:
                head=head.next #this is for skipping the values 
            return self.deleteDuplicates(head.next)
        else:
            head.next=self.deleteDuplicates(head.next) # this stores the actual value
            
        return head
```
